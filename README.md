# Suggestions:
# 1. start easy and hard-code users in a python list
# 2. add in the part that emails them (you could have users like leeannbaker15+user1@gmail.com, leeannbaker15+user2@gmail.com, etc... so they all go to you for testing)
# 3. instead of hard coding users, make it so you can call the script with an argument to add users. store them in a database (I'd use sqlite)
# 4. make it so you can call the script to display all users in the database, or maybe it would be cool to search for one. Being able to remove them would be nice too
# 5. if you feel really crazy, you could make it a webapp on something like google appengine with pages that list the users and options to add/remove (and obviously randomly match them)
